# Maryland state salaries, 2023

This is a repository for data on earnings by state workers in 2023. A CSV can be downloaded showing earnings for 146,113 entries. Of those entries, 131,166 are for names that appear in the data only once. Another 7,239 names appear more than once. These duplicates, which can occur if a worker switches organizations midyear, weren’t combined so that the data could be analyzed by organization. This data was published as part of a story, “Maryland paid workers over $7.9B in 2023. Who were the top earners?”

Data was requested from the Maryland Comptroller’s Office through the Public Information Act. The Baltimore Sun filed a request for annual salaries including regular, overtime and other earnings plus overtime hours. The Sun asked for “actual gross pay of every employee for a one-year period coinciding with the 2023 calendar year as displayed on W2 records. The "actual gross pay" should include overtime, expenses and other disbursements that would be added to the employee's annual salary.” The pay data provided was rounded to the nearest $1,000. Information on race and age is not available due to a provision in the Public Information Act that protects details in workers’ personnel files.
 
The charts in the story include all state workers who made any amount of money in 2023. The data includes regular, contract and University of Maryland workers paid at annual, hourly and daily rates. Median pay was calculated using all available data on yearly gross pay for workers who made anything in 2023. Gross annual pay includes regular, overtime and other pay.
 
Entries for workers whose gross earnings were zero were omitted by The Sun. Job titles were provided by the Maryland Comptroller’s Officer as codes. The Sun joined the codes with job codes from the Department of Budget Management. Codes are included for all organizations except the General Assembly of Maryland, Judiciary, Department of Transportation, the University of Maryland and State Universities and Colleges.
